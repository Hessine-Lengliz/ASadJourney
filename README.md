# A Sad Journey 🛤️🎮
A Sad Journey is a 2D pixel art platformer that serves as my first-ever game. Developed using Unity and C#, it offers an emotionally engaging experience as you guide a character through various levels filled with unique obstacles. Each level challenges players with accurate jumping mechanics, evading enemies (bats), navigating falling floors, and even facing a final boss. The game's central theme is about a person seeking what more life has to offer, culminating in an epic showdown to claim glory.
